## Overview

The Live Stock Predictor is designed to provide real-time stock predictions by:
- Fetching daily stock data using a `yfinance`-based script.
- Updating and training a predictive (OIL) model with the latest data.
- Visualizing predictions using a Plotly-powered dashboard.

All components are containerized for consistency, reproducibility, and ease of deployment using Docker Desktop.

## Architecture

The system is built as a multi-container Docker application, where each service operates in its own container:

- **PostgreSQL Database:** <br>
  Stores both the historical stock data (and subsequent features) as well as predictions.

- **Data Ingestion:**  
  Fetches daily stock data and stores it in the `stock_data` database.

- **Model Trainer & Predictor:**  
  Consumes the latest data, updates the predictive model, and saves new predictions to the `predictions` database.

- **Plotly Dashboard App:**  
  Retrieves prediction data from the `predictions` database and renders interactive visualizations.
